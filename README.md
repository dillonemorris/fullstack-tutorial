# Fullstack app for "From Frontend to Backend"

This is the fullstack app for my blog post called [From Frontend to Backend](https://dillonemorris.com/articles/from-frontend-to-backend)

## File structure

There are two folders, one for server and one for client.

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```
cd server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```
cd client && npm i && npm start
```
